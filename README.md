For this assignment, I was given a framework to optimise and improve upon. It was graded on various optimisation techniques and object-oriented programming. 

- Added new classes and refactored code to be more object-oriented
- Override new/delete functions with a header and footer
- Memory tracker
- Walking the heap
- Memory check values for maintaining memory integrity
- Looking into Quad Trees for usage in broad phase collision.
